- Age 3 is far too young for stress testing

Stress testing is typically performed in adults (typically 40+) with cardiac risk factors or symptoms.
There is NO CLINICAL INDICATION for this test in a healthy 3-year-old child.
This procedure would be:
1. Medically inappropriate
2. Potentially harmful to the child
3. Not supported by any pediatric guidelines

This charge should be reviewed immediately for billing error or wrong patient.
Continue appropriate management of recurrent ear infections.
Routine pediatric preventive care as needed.
