CLINICAL NOTES
==============
Patient is an 82-YEAR-OLD ELDERLY MALE with multiple comorbidities.

CRITICAL ERROR #1: Urine pregnancy test (CPT 81025) is ANATOMICALLY IMPOSSIBLE and MEDICALLY NONSENSICAL in this patient.
- Patient is MALE (no reproductive capacity for pregnancy)
- Patient is 82 years old (far beyond reproductive age)
- Pregnancy test in males serves NO clinical purpose
This represents either:
1. Serious billing error
2. Wrong patient identification
3. System malfunction

CRITICAL ERROR #2: Sports physical examination (CPT 99455) is MEDICALLY INAPPROPRIATE at age 82.
- Sports physicals are for athletes engaged in competitive sports
- Patient is 82 with significant comorbidities (AFib, CKD, osteoporosis)
- Patient is NOT a candidate for competitive athletics
- This procedure is not clinically appropriate for this elderly patient

IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION REQUIRED:
Both charges should be reviewed for billing errors or wrong patient assignment.

Continue appropriate geriatric management of AFib, CKD, and osteoporosis.
Monitor for drug interactions with warfarin.
