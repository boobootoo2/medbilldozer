CLINICAL NOTES
==============
Patient is a 15-YEAR-OLD FEMALE adolescent presenting for scoliosis monitoring.
INAPPROPRIATE SCREENING: Screening mammography (CPT 77067) is NOT indicated at this age.
Current Medical Guidelines:
- Average-risk women: Screening mammography starts at age 40-50
- High-risk women: May start earlier, but rarely before age 25-30
- Routine screening at age 15 is NOT recommended by any major medical organization

There is NO CLINICAL INDICATION for bilateral screening mammography in a healthy 15-year-old.
Adolescent breasts are dense and mammography is not an appropriate screening tool.

This charge appears to be medically inappropriate and should be reviewed for:
1. Correct patient identification
2. Correct procedure indication
3. Whether mammography was actually performed

Recommend reviewing billing records and clinical justification for this charge.
Continue routine monitoring of scoliosis.

Next Visit: March 2026
