CLINICAL NOTES
==============
Patient is a 34-year-old FEMALE with no genitourinary complaints.
CRITICAL FINDING: Prostate biopsy (CPT 55700) is ANATOMICALLY IMPOSSIBLE in this patient.
The prostate gland is a MALE-ONLY organ. Females do not have a prostate.
This charge represents either:
1. A billing error (wrong procedure code)
2. A clinical error (wrong patient)
3. Potential fraud

This procedure should be IMMEDIATELY REVIEWED and likely REVERSED.
Recommend contacting billing department for urgent clarification.

TSH level monitoring continues as appropriate for hypothyroidism management.
