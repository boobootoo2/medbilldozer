        "reasoning": "Patient with Child-Pugh Class B cirrhosis prescribed Acetaminophen 1000mg QID (4,000 mg/day total). Standard maximum dose is 4g/day in healthy adults, but patients with cirrhosis require dose reduction to maximum 2g/day due to impaired hepatic metabolism and increased acetaminophen toxicity risk. Prescribed dose doubles the safe maximum for cirrhotic patients, risking acute-on-chronic liver failure. NSAIDs also contraindicated due to portal hypertension and varices.",
