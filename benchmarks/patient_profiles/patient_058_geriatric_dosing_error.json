        "reasoning": "Patient is 87 years old with CrCl ~38 mL/min (CKD Stage 3B, weight 52kg). Dabigatran dosing for AFib with CrCl 30-50 mL/min should be 110mg BID in elderly patients, especially those >80 years or <60kg. Standard 150mg BID dose is for CrCl >50 mL/min. This overdosing significantly increases bleeding risk (GI bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage) in vulnerable elderly patient with marginal renal function. No reversal agent readily available.",
