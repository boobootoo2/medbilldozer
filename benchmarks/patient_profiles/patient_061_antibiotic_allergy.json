SJS is a life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reaction with 20-30% mortality. Re-exposure to culprit drug (sulfonamide antibiotics) can trigger recurrent SJS with higher severity. This is an absolute contraindication. Alternative antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin) must be used for UTI treatment.",
