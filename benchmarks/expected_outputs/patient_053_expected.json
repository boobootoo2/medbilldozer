        "fields_involved": ["medications", "prescriptions"],
        "reasoning": "Patient on Simvastatin 80mg daily prescribed Clarithromycin 500mg BID. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor that dramatically increases simvastatin serum levels. High-dose simvastatin (80mg) with CYP3A4 inhibitor causes rhabdomyolysis - severe muscle breakdown with myoglobinuria, acute kidney injury, potentially fatal outcome. FDA Black Box Warning specifically contraindicates this combination. Should use azithromycin or doxycycline instead.",
