        "reasoning": "Patient with documented primary open-angle glaucoma (on latanoprost therapy) prescribed Oxybutynin 5mg TID. Anticholinergic medications cause pupillary dilation (mydriasis) which can precipitate acute angle-closure glaucoma attack and worsen intraocular pressure control even in open-angle glaucoma. Risk of sudden IOP elevation causing severe eye pain, vision loss, potential permanent blindness. This is a contraindication in FDA labeling. Should use alternative therapy such as beta-3 agonist (mirabegron) which lacks anticholinergic effects.",
