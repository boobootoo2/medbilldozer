        "reasoning": "Patient has explicitly documented severe allergic reaction - Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) - to Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 2019 requiring ICU admission. Chart clearly states 'ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATION - DO NOT PRESCRIBE SULFA DRUGS'. Despite this, patient prescribed Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim DS (same drug, same class). SJS is a life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) with 20-30% mortality involving extensive skin sloughing, mucosal involvement, and multi-organ failure. Re-exposure to culprit drug triggers recurrent SJS with typically higher severity and faster onset. This is a catastrophic prescribing error. Must use alternative antibiotics: nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, or fosfomycin for UTI treatment.",
