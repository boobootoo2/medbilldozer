        "fields_involved": ["medications", "prescriptions"],
        "reasoning": "Patient on Digoxin 0.125mg daily started on Furosemide 80mg IV BID (high-dose loop diuretic). Furosemide causes significant potassium and magnesium wasting. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia dramatically increase digoxin binding to cardiac Na-K-ATPase, precipitating digoxin toxicity (arrhythmias, AV block, ventricular tachycardia). Elderly patient (79 years) at highest risk. Treatment plan lacks potassium/magnesium supplementation and monitoring protocol despite aggressive diuresis.",
