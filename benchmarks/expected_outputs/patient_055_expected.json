        "reasoning": "Patient with moderate persistent asthma (FEV1 72%, using controller medications) prescribed Propranolol 40mg BID. Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that blocks beta-2 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, causing bronchoconstriction and potentially severe bronchospasm. This is an absolute contraindication in asthma. Patient has documented aspirin-induced bronchospasm (aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease), indicating hyperreactive airways at even higher risk. If beta-blocker therapy necessary, must use cardioselective agent (metoprolol, atenolol) at lowest effective dose with close monitoring.",
