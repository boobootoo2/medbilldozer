# Ignore specific error codes
# E203: whitespace before ':' (conflicts with black)
# E302: expected 2 blank lines, found 1 (stylistic preference)
# E501: line too long (handled by max-line-length)
# W503: line break before binary operator (outdated rule)
# E402: module level import not at top of file (needed for streamlit mocking)
# W504: line break after binary operator (stylistic choice)
# E226: missing whitespace around arithmetic operator (stylistic in f-strings)
# E261: at least two spaces before inline comment (stylistic)
# E304: blank lines found after function decorator (auto-generated)
# E305: expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition (contextual)
# E306: expected 1 blank line before a nested definition (stylistic in nested funcs)
# F401: imported but unused (many are intentional for re-exports or test fixtures)
# F541: f-string is missing placeholders (used for consistency/templating)
# F811: redefinition of unused (test fixtures and multiple imports)
# F821: undefined name (conditionally defined or dynamic imports)
# F841: local variable assigned but never used (test fixtures, intentional)
# E131: continuation line unaligned (stylistic preference)
# E741: ambiguous variable name (short vars in list comprehensions)
# W291: trailing whitespace (handled by pre-commit)
# W292: no newline at end of file (handled by pre-commit)
# W391: blank line at end of file (handled by pre-commit)
