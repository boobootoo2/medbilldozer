“Medical billing errors aren’t rare — they’re systemic.

National surveys show nearly half of insured adults report receiving bills for care they believed should have been covered. At the system level, the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates over $100 billion a year in Medicare and Medicaid improper payments.

And while that number sounds abstract, it directly affects beneficiaries. Improper payments drive higher premiums, higher cost-sharing, and aggressive collections — meaning patients often pay first and dispute later, if they can at all.

Even at the encounter level, peer-reviewed research shows meaningful rates of overbilling tied to documentation and coding errors.

The real problem is fragmentation: bills, EOBs, pharmacy receipts, and provider records live in silos, and patients are left to reconcile them alone.

MedBillDozer is built to close that gap.”
