## Appendix: Re-branding Research

### Consumer Perception Study (Recommended)

**Objective:** Test current "medBillDozer" brand vs. alternatives

**Methodology:**
- Survey 500 target consumers (ages 25-65, insured)
- Show 4 brand options with brief descriptions
- Measure: trustworthiness, approachability, likelihood to try

**Hypotheses to Test:**
1. "Dozer" is perceived as empowering (not aggressive)
2. Medical/health prefix increases trust
3. Professional names (BillClarity) reduce B2C appeal

**Budget:** $8K (survey platform + recruiting)

### Competitive Brand Analysis

| Company | Brand Perception | Trust Score | Memorability | Key Insight |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| CoPatient | Professional, clinical | High | Low | Generic health tech name |
| Remedy | Accessible, healing | Medium | Medium | Positive connotation, not descriptive |
| Resolve | Serious, debt-focused | Low | Low | Negative association with collections |
| medBillDozer | Bold, action-oriented | ? | High | Memorable but untested for trust |

**Recommendation:** Commission brand perception study in Month 2-3 before major marketing investment.
