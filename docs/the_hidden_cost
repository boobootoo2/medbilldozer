# The Problem: Medical Billing Errors Are a Hidden Consumer Cost

## Executive Summary

Medical billing errors are widespread, costly, and disproportionately borne by consumers. While healthcare spending in the United States exceeds $4 trillion annually, a significant portion of the financial harm experienced by patients does not stem from the cost of care itself, but from administrative errors, claim mismatches, denied reimbursements, and unclaimed benefits.

Consumers routinely overpay, incur avoidable medical debt, or forfeit benefits they are legally entitled to — often without realizing it or lacking the tools to challenge the system.

**medBillDozer exists to close this gap.**

## 1. The Scale of Billing and Payment Errors

Public data from federal audits shows that payment inaccuracies are not edge cases:

- Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid collectively report **tens of billions of dollars per year** in improper payments.
- These include overpayments, underpayments, duplicate charges, incorrect coding, and documentation failures.
- Improper payments are *not synonymous with fraud* — many are routine administrative or billing errors.

This establishes a systemic baseline: **billing errors are common, expected, and large in aggregate.**

## 2. How These Errors Become Consumer Costs

Billing and claims errors cascade downstream to patients in predictable ways:

1. Incorrect patient responsibility amounts (copays, coinsurance, deductibles)
2. Denied or partially denied claims that shift costs onto consumers
3. Duplicate or inflated charges that go unnoticed
4. Delays or failures in reimbursement
5. Patient credits or refunds that are never returned

Because healthcare billing is opaque and fragmented, consumers are typically the *last* to know something went wrong — and often the only party financially penalized.

---

## 3. Low Error Detection and Appeal Rates

Even when consumers receive incorrect bills:

- Many do not realize an error has occurred
- Others lack the time, expertise, or documentation to challenge it
- Formal appeals are rare, despite evidence that many denials are reversible

As a result, **large volumes of correctable billing and coverage errors are never fixed**, effectively converting administrative mistakes into permanent consumer expenses.

---

## 4. Medical Debt as a Symptom, Not a Root Cause

Medical debt is often framed as a problem of healthcare affordability. In practice, it is frequently a **byproduct of billing failures**, including:

- Bills sent before insurance is properly applied
- Incorrect denial of covered services
- Charges for services already paid or adjusted
- Incorrect calculation of patient responsibility

Once an incorrect bill enters collections, the burden of proof shifts almost entirely to the consumer.

---

## 5. Unclaimed and Forfeited Consumer Benefits

Beyond direct overpayment, consumers also lose money through **unclaimed healthcare benefits**, such as:

- Flexible Spending Account (FSA) forfeitures
- Missed reimbursements due to missing or incorrect documentation
- Unreturned provider credits and stale refund checks
- Underutilized eligible benefits

Each year, **billions of dollars in consumer healthcare funds go unused or forfeited**, not because services were ineligible, but because the system failed to reconcile charges, coverage, and benefits correctly.

## 6. Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current approaches rely on one or more of the following:

- Manual review of complex medical bills
- Provider customer service calls with limited transparency
- Insurer portals that expose only partial claim context
- After-the-fact advocacy or debt assistance

These solutions are reactive, fragmented, and inaccessible to most patients.

## 7. The medBillDozer Approach

medBillDozer is designed to address the *root cause* of consumer harm:  
**lack of visibility and reconciliation across medical documents.**

### medBillDozer focuses on:

- Parsing and normalizing medical bills, EOBs, and receipts
- Reconciling billed, allowed, and patient responsibility amounts
- Detecting duplicate charges and coverage inconsistencies
- Highlighting potential overpayments, denials, and unclaimed benefits
- Explaining findings in plain language so consumers can act

Rather than replacing insurers or providers, medBillDozer empowers consumers with clarity and evidence.

---

## 8. The Opportunity

Even small improvements in detection and correction rates can yield meaningful consumer impact:

- Preventing avoidable out-of-pocket payments
- Reducing medical debt driven by billing errors
- Recovering unclaimed reimbursements and benefits
- Lowering the emotional and cognitive burden of healthcare administration

**The problem is not rare. The money is real. The tools are missing.**

medBillDozer is built to fill that gap.

## Conclusion

Medical billing errors represent one of the largest, least visible financial drains on American households. Consumers are expected to navigate a system they did not design, using documents they cannot interpret, under rules that vary by payer, provider, and plan.

medBillDozer reframes the problem: not as consumer failure, but as a solvable information and reconciliation challenge.

By making billing errors visible, understandable, and actionable, medBillDozer helps return control — and money — to patients.
