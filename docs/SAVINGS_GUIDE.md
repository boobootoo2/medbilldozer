# Understanding Your Savings Estimates

**How much could you save? Let's break it down.**

---

## 💰 What Are "Savings"?

When medBillDozer finds an error in your bill, it estimates the **maximum potential savings** you could recover if the issue is valid.

### Example:

**Issue Found:** Duplicate charge for X-ray  
**Billed Amount:** $250 (charged twice)  
**Your Responsibility:** $50 copay per X-ray  
**Potential Savings:** $50 (you'd avoid paying the second copay)

---

## 🎯 How We Calculate Savings

### The Formula:

```
Potential Savings = Patient Responsibility for Questionable Charge
```

**NOT** the full billed amount! Here's why:

### Example Breakdown:

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total Billed | $1,000 |
| Insurance Pays | $800 |
| You Pay (Copay/Deductible) | $200 |
| **Your Potential Savings** | **$200** |

If this charge is removed, you save **$200** (not $1,000, since insurance was paying $800).

## 🟢🟡🔴 Confidence Levels

Not all savings estimates are equally certain:

### 🟢 High Confidence (80-100%)
**Example:** Exact duplicate charge on same date  
**Meaning:** Very likely a real error  
**Action:** Strong case for dispute

### 🟡 Medium Confidence (50-79%)
**Example:** Unusual charge for patient's age/gender  
**Meaning:** Worth investigating  
**Action:** Contact provider for clarification

### 🔴 Low Confidence (Below 50%)
**Example:** Possible coding error  
**Meaning:** Possible issue, needs expert review  
**Action:** Ask provider to explain

---

## 📊 Types of Savings

### 1. **Duplicate Charges** 💰💰
Most common and easiest to recover!

**Example:**
- Same procedure charged twice on same day
- Same drug filled twice
- Duplicate office visit fee

**Typical Savings:** Full cost of duplicate charge

---

### 2. **Math Errors** 🔢
Addition/multiplication mistakes

**Example:**
- Bill shows 2 units @ $50 = $150 (should be $100)
- Deductible applied twice

**Typical Savings:** The overcharge amount

---

### 3. **Coding Errors** 📋
Wrong CPT/CDT code used

**Example:**
- Complex procedure code used for simple procedure
- Higher-tier service coded instead of basic

**Typical Savings:** Difference between codes

---

### 4. **Coverage Mismatches** 🏥
Service shouldn't be patient's responsibility

**Example:**
- Preventive care charged as diagnostic
- In-network provider charged as out-of-network

**Typical Savings:** Copay difference or full charge

---

### 5. **Age/Gender Inappropriate** 👤
Service impossible for patient demographics

**Example:**
- Pregnancy test for male patient
- Prostate exam for female patient

**Typical Savings:** Full patient responsibility for that service

---

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### These Are ESTIMATES, Not Guarantees

**Why?**

1. **Insurance Complexity**
   - Deductibles may apply
   - Out-of-pocket maximums
   - Coinsurance percentages vary

2. **Missing Information**
   - We see the bill, not your full insurance contract
   - Year-to-date amounts may affect savings

3. **Provider Policies**
   - Some providers may have legitimate reasons
   - Coding practices vary

4. **Negotiation Outcomes**
   - Actual savings depend on dispute resolution
   - Providers may offer partial credits

---

## 🤔 FAQ: Savings Questions

**Q: Why is my "total savings" less than the "billed amount"?**  
A: Because you only pay a portion (copay/deductible), not the full billed amount.

**Q: Can I really save this much?**  
A: Yes, IF the issue is valid and successfully disputed. Treat estimates as "maximum possible."

**Q: What if provider disagrees?**  
A: You can escalate to insurance, request peer review, or contact state regulator.

**Q: Are all findings worth disputing?**  
A: Prioritize 🟢 High confidence issues with >$50 savings for best ROI of your time.

**Q: How long does dispute resolution take?**  
A: Simple issues: days. Complex issues: 30-90 days.

**Q: Will disputing hurt my credit?**  
A: No, not if you're disputing in good faith. Don't ignore bills entirely!

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

1. **Savings = What YOU would save**, not total billed amount
2. **Confidence matters** - prioritize high-confidence findings
3. **Estimates ≠ Guarantees** - actual savings depend on dispute outcome
4. **Document everything** - keep records of your dispute
5. **Be persistent** - providers may resist at first
6. **Know your rights** - you have the right to dispute billing errors

**Remember:** Even small savings add up! A $50 error may not seem huge, but across multiple bills, patients can recover hundreds or thousands of dollars. 💪
